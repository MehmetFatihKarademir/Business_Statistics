# Question 1 

## Linear Model Using GBP

Sales difference for stores participating in the trial is 426,893  GBP 95% CI [-78,951 -- 115,128]. The sales difference for stores not participating in the trial is 18,089 GBP 95% CI [327,304 -- 526,482]. The sales difference is 408,804 GBP 95% CI [-547,853 -- -269,755] less for stores that do not participate in the trial. 

The sales difference varies significantly by whether a store participates in the trial or not, F = 33.354, p= 1.3e-08.

## Linear Model Using GBP Percentage

Sales change for stores participating in the trial is 1.416 95% CI [-0.449 --  0.653]. The sales change for stores not participating in the trial is 0.102% 95% CI [0.850 -- 1.981]. The sales difference is -1.31% 95% CI [-2.1  -- -0.525] less for stores that do not participate in the trial. 

The sales difference varies significantly by whether a store participates in the trial or not, F = 10.696, p= 0.001143.

# GBP or Percentages

I would use the percentage difference for the remaining analysis because of how much more normally distributed it is. Because I can not be sure if the outliers are truly outliers, I cannot remove them. For this reason, I believe it is better to normalize the data as a percent. 

It makes much more sense to use percentages when talking about all stores' sales difference. There are certainly very small stores who's total yearly sales do not come close to the estimated mean sales difference in GBP. All stores who participate in the trial have, on average, a sales change of 1.3% compared to those who dont. This makes much more sense when considering the fact that there could be very small stores whos total yearly profit is not even hald of the estimated mean GBP sales difference. 



# Question 2

## Percent Sales Change Controlling for Intrial and Outlettype

The sales difference percentage varies significantly across outlet types by whether a store participates in the trial or not, F = 47.891, p= < 2.2e-16.

![Figure 1: Estimation Approach Using GBP as Percent](000004.png)

The chart above shows the output of the estimation approach for the effect of intrial and outlettype on percent difference. From the chart above, it can be seen that all outlet types that participate in the trial seem to have an percent increase in sales. While the confidence intervals are greater for outlets that participate in the trial, we cannot say that this difference is different than 0 becasue the confidence intervals touch. 

## Percent Sales Change Controlling for Intrial, outlettype, and staff_turnover

The sales difference percentage does not vary significantly by changes in staff_turnover, F = 0.7113, p= 0.3993862.

![Figure 1: Estimation Approach Using GBP as Percent](fatih.png)

From the graphs, which plot the estimation approach data, it seems as if staff_turnover does not improve the fit of the model. The two charts look identical, which would indicate that staff_turnover does not imporve the model.

# Question 2

```{r}
#question 2
LinearModel3 <- lm(salesperc~intrial + outlettype, data=salesdata)
(  LinearModel3.emm <- emmeans(LinearModel3, ~intrial + outlettype)  )
(  LinearModel3.contrast <- confint(pairs(LinearModel3.emm))  )

anova(LinearModel3)

```
The sales difference percentage varies significantly across outlet types by whether a store participates in the trial or not, F = 47.891, p= < 2.2e-16.


```{r}
 ggplot(summary(LinearModel3.emm), aes(x=outlettype, y=emmean, ymin=lower.CL, ymax=upper.CL, color = intrial)) + geom_point() + geom_linerange() + labs(title = "Percent Sales Change by Outlettype and Intrial", y = "Percent Change", x = "Outlettype")
```
The chart above shows the output of the estimation approach for the effect of intrial and outlettype on percent difference. From the chart above, it can be seen that all outlet types that participate in the trial seem to have an percent increase in sales. While the confidence intervals are greater for outlets that participate in the trial, we cannot say that this difference is different than 0 becasue the confidence intervals touch. 




Outlettype with Staff_turnover
```{r}
#Using linear model to see how outlettype and staff_turnover effects the sales 
LinearModel4 <- lm(salesperc~intrial + outlettype * staff_turnover, data=salesdata)
(  LinearModel4.emm <- emmeans(LinearModel4, ~intrial + outlettype * staff_turnover)  )
(  LinearModel4.contrast <- confint(pairs(LinearModel4.emm))  )

anova(LinearModel4)

```

The sales difference percentage does not vary significantly by changes in staff_turnover, F = 0.7113, p= 0.3993862.


```{r}
grid.arrange(
ggplot(summary(LinearModel4.emm), aes(x=outlettype, y=emmean, ymin=lower.CL, ymax=upper.CL, color = intrial)) + geom_point() + geom_linerange() + labs( y = "Percent Change", title = "Percentage Change by Intrial and Outlettype"),
ggplot(summary(LinearModel3.emm), aes(x=outlettype, y=emmean, ymin=lower.CL, ymax=upper.CL, color = intrial)) + geom_point() + geom_linerange()+ labs( y = "Percent Change", title = "Percentage Change by Intrial, Outlettype, and Staff_turnover"))

```
From the graphs, which plot the estimation approach data, it seems as if staff_turnover does not improve the fit of the model. The two charts look identical, which would indicate that staff_turnover does not imporve the model. 


Does Staff_turnover improve the fit? 
```{r}
anova(LinearModel4, LinearModel3)
```
When comparing the two models, it is evident that the sales difference percentage does not vary significantly by changes in staff_turnover, F = 1.0004 , p= 0.3923.
